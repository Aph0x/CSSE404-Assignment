# Reliability Metrics

## 1. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)

- **Definition**: Average operational time between system failures.
- **Justification**: MTBF helps assess the reliability of the banking system. A high MTBF indicates a stable system, critical for user trust and uninterrupted service.

## 2. Availability (Uptime Percentage)

**Definition**: The percentage of total time the system is available and responsive.  
**Justification**: Online banking requires near-constant availability. Downtime results in customer dissatisfaction and financial risk. A target of 99.9% or higher is considered industry standard.
