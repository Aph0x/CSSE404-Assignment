# Online Banking System

This project models a secure online banking system that enables users to perform essential financial operations such as checking account balances, transferring money, and managing personal details. The system is designed with a strong emphasis on security, reliability, and performance.

## Justification for Security and Dependability

Due to the sensitivity of financial data and high trust expectations from users, this system requires strong authentication mechanisms, encrypted communication, and high availability. A security breach or system downtime could result in financial losses and erode user trust, making security and dependability top priorities.
